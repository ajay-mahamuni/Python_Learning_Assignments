Python Programming
Assignment : 11

As we discussed in the session before writing recursive solution

please write the code using iteration.

1. Print Numbers Using Recursion
Write a recursive function to print numbers from 1 to N.
Expected Output (for n=5):
1 2 3 4 5

2. Factorial Using Recursion
Write a recursive function to calculate factorial of a number.
factorial(5) → 120

3. Sum of Digits
Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
sum_of_digits(1234) → 10
4. Power Function Using Recursion
Write a recursive function to calculate x^n.
power(2, 3) → 8

5. Count Zeros in a Number (Recursively)
Write a recursive function to count how many zeros are in the given number.
count_zeros(1020300) → 4

6. Sum of First N Natural Numbers
Write a recursive function to calculate sum from 1 to n.
sum_n(5) → 15

7. Print Pattern Using Recursion (Right Triangle)
Write a recursive function to print the following pattern:
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
