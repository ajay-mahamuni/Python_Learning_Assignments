Automation Assignment : 19

Please follow below rules while designing automation script as
• Accept input through command line or through file.
• Display any message in log file instead of console.
• For separate task define separate function.
• For robustness handle every expected exception.
• Perform validations before taking any action.
• Create user defined modules to store the functionality.

1.Design automation script which accept directory name and file extension from user. Display all
files with that extension.
Usage : DirectoryFileSearch.py “Demo” “.txt”
Demo is name of directory and .txt is the extension that we want to search.

2. Design automation script which accept directory name and two file extensions from user.
Rename all files with first file extension with the second file extenntion.
Usage : DirectoryRename.py “Demo” “.txt” “.doc”
Demo is name of directory and .txt is the extension that we want to search and rename
with .doc.
After execution this script each .txt file gets renamed as .doc.

3. Design automation script which accept two directory names. Copy all files from first directory
into second directory. Second directory should be created at run time.
Usage : DirectoryCopy.py “Demo” “Temp”
Demo is name of directory which is existing and contains files in it. We have to create new
Directory as Temp and copy all files from Demo to Temp.

4. Design automation script which accept two directory names and one file extension. Copy all
files with the specified extension from first directory into second directory. Second directory
should be created at run time.
Usage : DirectoryCopyExt.py “Demo” “Temp” “.exe”
Demo is name of directory which is existing and contains files in it. We have to create new
Directory as Temp and copy all files with extension .exe from Demo to Temp.
